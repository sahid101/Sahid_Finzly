The Foreign Exchange program is a Java project designed to perform currency conversion from
United States Dollars (USD) to Indian Rupees (INR).
This project provides a simple command-line interface for users to input an amount in USD and get
the equivalent amount in INR based on the current exchange rate.

Keypoint:
Foreign exchange, also known as forex, is the conversion of one country's currency into another.
The value of any particular currency is determined by market forces related to trade, investment, tourism, and geopolitical risk.
Foreign exchange is handled globally between banks and all transactions fall under the auspice of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
